# psm-at-stamp-v2-ios
PSM @ STAMP is an online stamping system for tracking the student activity in the academic days at Satitprasarnmit Demonstration School (Secondary)

## About PSM @ STAMP
PSM @ STAMP was formed in 2017 with an idea to stop using the normal paper stamp to reduce usage of paper and the human error in the activity tracking system in my school. The idea is to use the phone to scan the `qr code` which contained the excrypted data that will be avaliable for a short period of time (In my case, It was set to 30s). To check the validity of the qr code. I use the dencryption process and check if the data matched with the data in my server. By using this method, We can also check that when the code was created and limit the time of validity for this qr code.

## Message From Developer
Now I decided to deprecate this project and make the code in this repo to be an open source. The code in the repo is not the best. It was written when I was 16. Actually, This is my first project writtin on iOS (hahaha). I really hope this might be an idea for someone who seek it :).
